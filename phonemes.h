// Note: The above definitions are used to map phonemes to their respective allophone codes.
// These codes are used in the speech synthesis process to generate spoken output based on the phonetic representation of words.
// The phonemes.h file is essential for the speech synthesis functionality of the SP0256-AL2 chip, allowing it to produce intelligible speech by combining these phonemes in various sequences.
// Each phoneme corresponds to a specific sound in the English language, and the definitions provided here are used in conjunction with the speech synthesis code to create spoken words and sentences.

// The phonemes.h file is part of a larger project that includes the SCZ180 microcontroller and the SP0256-AL2 speech synthesis chip.
// The definitions in this file are used to control the speech synthesis process, allowing the microcontroller to produce speech by sending the appropriate allophone codes to the SP0256-AL2 chip.

// The phonemes are defined in a way that allows for easy reference in the speech synthesis code.
// Each phoneme is assigned a unique identifier, which can be used to refer to it in the code.
// This makes it easier to construct sentences and phrases by combining different phonemes together.

// The definitions provided here are based on the SP0256-AL2 documentation and are used in the speech synthesis process to generate intelligible speech.
