# SP0256-AL2 Speech Synthesizer (Z80 / Z88DK)

A classic, no-nonsense driver and toolchain for driving the General Instrument SP0256-AL2 allophone speech chip from a Z80 CPU, built with the Z88DK toolkit.

This has been tested and is working on the following hardware:

## üìú Overview

This project delivers a proven, straightforward implementation of SP0256-AL2 speech synthesis, using:

- **Allophone table** mapping decimal codes (0‚Äì63) to phonemes  
- A **C header** (`phonemes.h`) for easy phoneme reference in your Z80 code  
- Example Z80 driver code targeting the SCZ180+SP0256-AL2 platform  
- Integration with **Z88DK** for cross-compiling your speech programs

By sticking to time-tested patterns and a clear allophone mapping, you get reliable speech output with minimal runtime overhead.

## üéØ Features

- **Complete allophone mapping**: Decimal values 0‚Äì63 ‚Üí phoneme names (stored in `include/phonemes.h`)
- **C driver** for SP0256-AL2 control and data latching  
- **Z88DK build scripts** for seamless cross-compilation to Z80 targets  
- **Minimal dependencies**‚Äîjust a [Z80 system](https://www.tindie.com/products/tindiescx/sc126-z180-sbcmotherboard-kit-for-rcbus/), [SP0256-AL2](https://www.tindie.com/products/mrgelee/mg005-speech-synthesiser-designed-for-rc2014/?pt=ac_prod_search), and [Z88DK](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk)

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Z88DK** (Z80 C development toolkit)  
  Clone or install from:  
  [https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk)

- A **Z80-based target** (e.g., SCZ180, CP/M, custom board) wired to an SP0256-AL2
  
---

## üöÄ Building & Installation

1. **Clone this repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cerkit/sp0256-synth.git
   cd sp0256-synth
   ```
2. Ensure that the Z88DK binaries are in your PATH: `export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/z88dk/bin           
export ZCCCFG=${HOME}/z88dk/lib/config`

3. **Build your PROGRAM.bin file**  
   ```bash
   zcc +scz180 -o future future_speech.c -create-app
   ```
4. **Upload** the generated binary (`future.bin` to `future.com`) to your retro computer using XMODEM (I am using the [`serial`](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/serial/id877615577?mt=12)) program for MacOS).
  ``` bash
    c:
    b:xm r future.com
  ```
- Choose to Send File by XMODEM in terminal program
- Upload the future.bin file

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

- **In Z80 code**, include the headers:
  ```c
  #include <z180.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "phonemes.h"  // Include allophone definitions
  ```

## üìù References

- **Z88DK** ‚Äì Z80 C compiler toolkit  
  [https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk)
- **General Instrument SP0256-AL2 Datasheet**
- **Allophone definitions** from `include/phonemes.h`
